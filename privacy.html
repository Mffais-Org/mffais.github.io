      <h3>Cookies / Tracking Technologies</h3>
      <p>
        A cookie, which is a small text file stored on a user’s computer for
        record-keeping purposes, is used on our Site. We do not link the
        information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable
        information you submit while on the Site.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID
        cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains
        on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove
        persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet
        browser’s “help” directory.
      </p>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>
        The security of your personal information is important to us. When you
        enter sensitive information, such as a credit card number or financial
        information, on our forms, we encrypt the transmission of that
        information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
      </p>
      <p>
        We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal
        information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we
        receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or
        electronic storage method is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee
        its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on the
        Site, please contact us.
      </p>
